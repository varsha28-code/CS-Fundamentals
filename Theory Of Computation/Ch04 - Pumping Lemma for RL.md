# Chapter 4: Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages

The Pumping Lemma is a powerful tool used to prove that certain languages are **not regular**. It describes a property that every regular language must satisfy. If a language violates this property, it cannot be regular.

## 1. Statement of the Pumping Lemma

Let $L$ be a **regular language**. Then there exists an integer $p \geq 1$ (called the **pumping length**) such that **every** string $s \in L$ with $|s| \ge p$ can be written as $s = xyz$, satisfying:

1. $|y| \ge 1$ (the pumped part is non-empty)
2. $|xy| \le p$ (the first $p$ symbols contain the pumping part)
3. For all $i \ge 0$, $xy^i z \in L$ (the string can be "pumped" any number of times)

> In any sufficiently long string of a regular language, there is a non-empty substring near the beginning that can be repeated any number of times (including zero), and the resulting strings will still belong to the language.

---

## 2. Proof Idea of the Pumping Lemma

The proof relies on the fact that a regular language is accepted by a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)** with a finite number of states.

- Let the DFA have $p$ states.
- Consider a string $s$ of length $\ge p$.
- When the DFA reads $s$, it visits a sequence of states: $q_0 \to q_1 \to \cdots \to q_n$ where $n = |s|$.
- Since there are only $p$ states, by the pigeonhole principle, some state must repeat within the first $p+1$ steps.
- Let $q_i = q_j$ be the first repetition ($i < j \le p$).
- Then the substring $y$ between $q_i$ and $q_j$ can be **pumped** - repeated any number of times - and the DFA will still end in an accepting state (if the original string was accepted).

### DFA with a pumping cycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph DFA
        q0((q0)) -->|x| qi((qi))
        qi -->|y| qj((qj))
        qj -->|z| qacc((Accept))
        qi -.->|pump y| qj
    end
    style qi fill:#9cf
    style qj fill:#9cf
```

- $x$ moves from start $q_0$ to the first occurrence of the repeated state $q_i$.
- $y$ moves from $q_i$ to $q_j$ (the loop, can be repeated).
- $z$ moves from $q_j$ to an accept state.

Because $q_i = q_j$, we can go around the loop $i$ times, giving $xy^i z$ for any $i \ge 0$.

## 3. Application of the Pumping Lemma

To prove a language $L$ is **not regular**, we use **proof by contradiction**:

1. **Assume** $L$ is regular. Then the pumping lemma holds for some pumping length $p$.
2. **Choose** a clever string $s \in L$ with $|s| \ge p$ that will lead to a contradiction.
3. **Consider all possible ways** to split $s = xyz$ satisfying $|y| \ge 1$ and $|xy| \le p$.
4. **Show** that for every such split, there exists some $i \ge 0$ such that $xy^i z \notin L$.
5. **Conclude** that our assumption was false - $L$ is not regular.

### Example: Prove $L = \{ 0^n 1^n \mid n \ge 0 \}$ is not regular

- Assume $L$ is regular with pumping length $p$.
- Choose $s = 0^p 1^p$ (length $2p \ge p$).
- By the lemma, $s = xyz$ with $|xy| \le p$ and $|y| \ge 1$.
- Since $|xy| \le p$, the part $xy$ lies entirely within the block of $0$'s.
  So $y = 0^k$ for some $k \ge 1$.
- Pump $y$ **up** (choose $i = 2$):
  $xy^2 z = 0^{p+k} 1^p$.
  This string has more $0$'s than $1$'s, so it is **not** in $L$.
- Contradiction. Hence $L$ is not regular.

## 4. Techniques to Prove Languages are Non-Regular

### 4.1 Standard Pumping Lemma Strategy

- Choose $s$ that depends on $p$.
- Ensure $|xy| \le p$ forces $y$ to lie in a specific part of $s$.
- Pump up or down to break the pattern.

### 4.2 Closure Properties + Pumping Lemma

Sometimes it is easier to combine the pumping lemma with operations that preserve regularity.

**Example**: Prove $L = \{ w \mid w \text{ has equal number of 0's and 1's} \}$ is not regular.

- Intersect $L$ with the regular language $0^*1^*$.
  The result is $\{ 0^n1^n \}$, which is non-regular.
- If $L$ were regular, the intersection would also be regular (regular languages are closed under intersection). Contradiction.

### 4.3 Using Homomorphisms

Apply a string homomorphism to map the language to a known non-regular language.

### 4.4 Myhill-Nerode Theorem (alternative to pumping)

The Myhill-Nerode theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition for regularity (infinite number of distinguishable prefixes). It can sometimes prove non-regularity more easily, but the pumping lemma is more common for introductory courses.

### 4.5 Example: Palindrome Language

Prove $L = \{ w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid w = w^R \}$ (palindromes) is not regular.

- Choose $s = 0^p 1 0^p$.
- With $|xy| \le p$, $y$ consists only of $0$'s from the first block.
- Pumping changes the number of leading $0$'s but not the trailing $0$'s, breaking the palindrome property.

## 5. Limitations of the Pumping Lemma

The pumping lemma is a **necessary** condition for regularity, but **not sufficient**.
Some non-regular languages **satisfy** the pumping lemma - they can be "pumped" but are still not regular.

### 5.1 Example: A Non-regular Language that Satisfies the Pumping Lemma

Let $L = \{ a^i b^j c^k \mid i,j,k \ge 0 \text{ and if } i=1 \text{ then } j=k \}$

- This language is not regular (can be shown with Myhill-Nerode).
- Yet it **does** satisfy the pumping lemma (careful choice of pumping length works).

### 5.2 What the Pumping Lemma Cannot Do

- It **cannot prove** that a language **is** regular.
- It may fail for languages that require more sophisticated arguments (e.g., context-free pumping lemma needed for $\{ a^n b^n c^n \}$).
- Some non-regular languages require **Ogden's lemma** (a stronger version for context-free languages) or the Myhill-Nerode theorem.

### 5.3 When the Pumping Lemma Fails to Prove Non-regularity

Consider $L = \{ a^n b^m \mid n \neq m \}$.
The pumping lemma **can** prove it is not regular (choose $s = a^p b^{p+p!}$ or similar).
But if a language satisfies the pumping lemma, you must use other methods.

### Diagram: Limitations Overview

```mermaid

        end
    end
    R --> P
    N --> P
    P -.->|Not all regular? Actually R subset P| R
    style R fill:#9f9
    style N fill:#f99
    style P fill:#ff9
```

**Key takeaway**
- Every regular language satisfies the pumping lemma ($R \subseteq P$).
- Some non-regular languages also satisfy it ($P \nsubseteq R$).
- Therefore, satisfying the pumping lemma does **not** guarantee regularity.

*The pumping lemma is a fundamental tool in the theory of computation, but it must be applied carefully. Use closure properties or Myhill-Nerode when the pumping lemma is inconclusive.*
