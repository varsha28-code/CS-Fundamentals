# Chapter 5: Context‑Free Grammars (CFG)

Context‑free grammars generate context‑free languages, a superset of regular languages. They are fundamental in programming language syntax, natural language processing, and compiler design.

---

## 1. Components of a CFG (V, Σ, R, S)

A context‑free grammar is a 4‑tuple $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$:

- **V** – finite set of *non‑terminal* symbols (variables)
- **Σ** – finite set of *terminal* symbols (alphabet), disjoint from V
- **R** – finite set of *production rules* of the form $A \to \alpha$, where $A \in V$ and $\alpha \in (V \cup \Sigma)^*$ (any string of terminals and non‑terminals)
- **S** – the *start symbol* ($S \in V$)

### Example: Grammar for balanced parentheses
- $V = \{S\}$
- $\Sigma = \{(,)\}$
- $R = \{ S \to \varepsilon,\; S \to (S),\; S \to SS \}$
- $S$ is start symbol

---

## 2. Derivations and Sentential Forms

A **derivation** is a sequence of replacements of non‑terminals using production rules, starting from $S$ and ending with a string of only terminals (a sentence).

If $\alpha \Rightarrow \beta$ (one step), replace one non‑terminal in $\alpha$ using a rule.  
The reflexive transitive closure $\Rightarrow^*$ means zero or more steps.

A **sentential form** is any string of terminals and non‑terminals that appears in a derivation (including intermediate steps).

### Example derivation (balanced parentheses grammar):
$S \Rightarrow SS \Rightarrow (S)S \Rightarrow (SS)S \Rightarrow (()S)S \Rightarrow (())S \Rightarrow (())$  

Here $SS, (S)S, (SS)S, (()S)S, (())S, (())$ are sentential forms; the last one is a sentence.

---

## 3. Leftmost and Rightmost Derivations

- **Leftmost derivation** – always replace the leftmost non‑terminal.
- **Rightmost derivation** – always replace the rightmost non‑terminal.

For the same sentence, leftmost and rightmost derivations can be different.

### Example: Grammar $S \to AB,\; A \to a,\; B \to b$

- Leftmost: $S \Rightarrow AB \Rightarrow aB \Rightarrow ab$  
- Rightmost: $S \Rightarrow AB \Rightarrow Ab \Rightarrow ab$

In unambiguous grammars, both are unique for a given sentence. In ambiguous grammars, multiple leftmost (or rightmost) derivations exist.

---

## 4. Parse Trees

A parse tree is a graphical representation of a derivation.  
- Root: start symbol $S$  
- Internal nodes: non‑terminals  
- Children: right‑hand side of a rule applied to the parent  
- Leaves: terminals (or ε) in left‑to‑right order forming the sentence.

### Mermaid diagram of parse tree for `(())` from grammar $S \to \varepsilon \mid (S) \mid SS$:

```mermaid
graph TD
    S0[S] --> L1["("]
    S0 --> S1[S]
    S0 --> R1[")"]
    S1 --> L2["("]
    S1 --> S2[S]
    S1 --> R2[")"]
    S2 --> eps[ε]
    style eps fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

(We often write ε as a leaf with no symbol, but for visibility we put a node labeled ε.)

Parse trees abstract away the order of replacements (leftmost vs rightmost) and show only the structural grouping.

---

## 5. Ambiguity in Context‑Free Grammars

A grammar is **ambiguous** if there exists at least one string that has more than one distinct parse tree (equivalently, more than one leftmost derivation or more than one rightmost derivation).

### Example: Classic ambiguous grammar for arithmetic expressions
$E \to E+E \mid E*E \mid (E) \mid id$

String `id+id*id` has two parse trees:

**Tree 1** (multiplication before addition – intended):
```mermaid
graph TD
    E0[E] --> E1[E]
    E0 --> P["+"]
    E0 --> E2[E]
    E1 --> id1[id]
    E2 --> E3[E]
    E2 --> M["*"]
    E2 --> E4[E]
    E3 --> id2[id]
    E4 --> id3[id]
```

**Tree 2** (addition before multiplication – wrong precedence):
```mermaid
graph TD
    E0[E] --> E1[E]
    E0 --> M["*"]
    E0 --> E2[E]
    E1 --> E3[E]
    E1 --> P["+"]
    E1 --> E4[E]
    E3 --> id1[id]
    E4 --> id2[id]
    E2 --> id3[id]
```

Thus the grammar is ambiguous.

### Removing Ambiguity (Where Possible)

Some ambiguous grammars can be rewritten to be unambiguous by introducing precedence and associativity rules.

**Unambiguous version** for arithmetic:

- $E \to E+T \mid T$
- $T \to T*F \mid F$
- $F \to (E) \mid id$

Now `id+id*id` has only one parse tree: multiplication deeper (higher precedence).

Not every CFG can be made unambiguous (see inherently ambiguous languages below).

---

## 6. Inherently Ambiguous Languages

A **context‑free language** $L$ is **inherently ambiguous** if every CFG generating $L$ is ambiguous. No unambiguous grammar exists for $L$.

### Classic example: $L = \{ a^n b^n c^m \mid n,m \ge 0 \} \cup \{ a^n b^m c^m \mid n,m \ge 0 \}$

- Strings of form $a^n b^n c^n$ have two distinct structural interpretations: either as part of the first set (matching a's and b's first) or second set (matching b's and c's).
- Proved via Ogden’s lemma (a generalisation of the pumping lemma for CFLs).

Another example: $\{ a^i b^j c^k \mid i=j \text{ or } j=k \}$.

### Why inherent ambiguity matters:
- Some programming language constructs (e.g., ambiguous `if-then-else` can be resolved with disambiguation rules, but the language itself is not inherently ambiguous).
- For parser generators, inherent ambiguity means no deterministic parser exists for that language.

## Comparison Table: CFG vs Regular Grammar

| Property | Regular Grammar (Type 3) | CFG (Type 2) |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Rules form | $A \to aB \mid \varepsilon$ | $A \to \alpha, \alpha \in (V\cup\Sigma)^*$ |
| Derivation capacity | Cannot count nested parentheses | Can count (balanced parentheses) |
| Ambiguity possible? | No (regular languages have unambiguous DFA, hence unambiguous regex) | Yes |
| Pumping lemma | $uv^iw$ | $uv^ixy^iz$ (with two pumping parts) |
| Closure properties | Closed under union, intersection, complement, etc. | Closed under union, concatenation, Kleene star, but **not** under intersection or complement |

---

## Example: Complete CFG for simple arithmetic (unambiguous)

$G = (V,\Sigma,R,E)$  
- $V = \{E, T, F\}$  
- $\Sigma = \{+, *, (, ), id\}$  
- $R$:
    1. $E \to E+T \mid T$  
    2. $T \to T*F \mid F$  
    3. $F \to (E) \mid id$

**Leftmost derivation of `id+id*id`:**  
```text
E => E+T => T+T => F+T => id+T => id+T*F => id+F*F => id+id*F => id+id*id
```

**Parse tree**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    E[E] --> E1[E]
    E --> plus["+"]
    E --> T1[T]
    E1 --> T2[T]
    T2 --> F1[F]
    F1 --> id1[id]
    T1 --> T3[T]
    T1 --> star["*"]
    T1 --> F2[F]
    T3 --> F3[F]
    F3 --> id2[id]
    F2 --> id3[id]
```

This grammar is unambiguous, unlike the earlier ambiguous version.

## Decision Properties of CFLs (briefly)

Unlike regular languages, many properties of CFLs are **undecidable**:
- Emptiness: decidable (check if start symbol can generate any terminal string)
- Finiteness: decidable (check for cycles that generate infinite strings)
- Membership (CYK algorithm for CNF grammars): decidable, $O(n^3)$
- **Equivalence** of two CFGs: undecidable
- **Ambiguity** (whether a given CFG is ambiguous): undecidable
- **Inherent ambiguity** of a language: undecidable

---

## Summary

- CFGs consist of non‑terminals, terminals, production rules, and a start symbol.
- Derivations (leftmost/rightmost) and parse trees capture syntax structure.
- Ambiguity occurs when a string has multiple parse trees; some grammars can be made unambiguous, but some languages are inherently ambiguous.
- CFGs are more powerful than regular expressions but still have limitations (e.g., cannot check $a^n b^n c^n$).
