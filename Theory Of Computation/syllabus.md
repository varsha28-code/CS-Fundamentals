- Church–Turing thesis

---

## Chapter 10. Decidability and Undecidability

- Recursive (decidable) vs Recursively enumerable (r.e.) languages
- Decidable languages – membership can be decided by a TM that always halts
- Undecidable languages – no TM decides membership
- Halting problem – statement and proof of undecidability (diagonalisation)
- Reductions and reduction techniques (many‑one / mapping reductions)
- Rice’s Theorem – any non‑trivial property of r.e. languages is undecidable

---

## Chapter 11. Chomsky Hierarchy

- Type‑0: Recursively Enumerable Languages (Turing machines)
- Type‑1: Context‑Sensitive Languages (Linear Bounded Automata – LBA)
  - Definition of LBA (Turing machine with bounded tape)
  - Example: `{aⁿbⁿcⁿ | n≥0}` is context‑sensitive
- Type‑2: Context‑Free Languages (Pushdown automata)
- Type‑3: Regular Languages (Finite automata)
- Relationships among language classes (proper inclusions: Regular ⊂ CFL ⊂ CSL ⊂ Recursive ⊂ RE)
- Closure and decision properties across the hierarchy

---

## Chapter 12. Introduction to Computational Complexity

- Time complexity – worst‑case number of steps
- Space complexity – worst‑case number of tape cells used
- Asymptotic notations (Big‑O, Big‑Ω, Big‑Θ) applied to TM resources
