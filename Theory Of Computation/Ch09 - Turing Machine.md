## Chapter 9: Turing Machine

This chapter introduces the most powerful classical model of computation: the **Turing Machine (TM)**. Turing Machines formalize the notion of an algorithm and form the base of computability and complexity theory.

## 1. Definition and Components of a Turing Machine (7-tuple)

A deterministic Turing Machine is defined by:

- A finite set of states $Q$
- An input alphabet $\Sigma$ (does not include blank)
- A tape alphabet $\Gamma$ ($\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$, and blank belongs to $\Gamma$)
- A transition function $\delta: Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}$
- A start state $q_0 \in Q$
- An accept state $q_{accept} \in Q$
- A reject state $q_{reject} \in Q$, where $q_{accept} \ne q_{reject}$

Formal 7-tuple:

$$
M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})
$$

### Diagram of a Turing Machine

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph TM ["Turing Machine"]
        direction TB
        Controller["Finite Control\n(State)"]
        TapeHead["Read/Write Head"]
    end
    Tape["... | B | a | b | a | B | ..."]
    TapeHead --> Tape
    Controller --> TapeHead
```

The tape is conceptually unbounded in both directions. Initially, input is written on the tape with blank symbols around it, and the head starts at the first input symbol.

## 2. Instantaneous Descriptions (ID) and Computation

An **Instantaneous Description (ID)** captures one full machine configuration: tape content, head position, and current state.

A common notation is:

$$
x_1 x_2 \dots x_{i-1}\; q\; x_i x_{i+1} \dots x_n
$$

where the head scans $x_i$ and the current state is $q$.

Example ID:

$$
B\ a\ b\ q_2\ c\ B
$$

This means the head is on $c$, and the machine is in state $q_2$.

### How a TM computes

1. Start in $q_0$ with input $w$ on tape.
2. Repeatedly apply transitions.
3. If $\delta(q, a) = (q', b, d)$, then:
   - write $b$
   - move head in direction $d \in \{L, R\}$
   - change state to $q'$
4. Halt when entering $q_{accept}$ or $q_{reject}$.

A TM **accepts** $w$ if it eventually enters $q_{accept}$. It **rejects** if it enters $q_{reject}$. If it never halts, then it does not accept.

    q0 --> q_reject: B -> B, R
    q1 --> q_accept: B -> B, R
    q_accept --> [*]
    q_reject --> [*]
```

## 3. Language Acceptance by Turing Machine

The language recognized by a TM $M$ is:

$$
L(M) = \{\, w \in \Sigma^* \mid M \text{ accepts } w \,\}
$$

- Languages recognized by TMs are called **Turing-recognizable** (or recursively enumerable).
- If a TM halts on every input, its language is **decidable** (recursive).

---

## 4. Designing TMs for Simple Languages

### Example 1

$$
L = \{a^n b^n \mid n \ge 1\}
$$

Strategy:

- Mark the leftmost unmarked $a$ as $X$
- Move right and mark the matching $b$ as $Y$
- Return left and repeat
- Accept when all symbols are matched

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> q0
    q0 --> q1: a → X, R
    q0 --> q_reject: b
    q0 --> q_reject: B
    q1 --> q1: a → a, R
    q1 --> q1: Y → Y, R
    q1 --> q2: b → Y, L
    q2 --> q2: a → a, L
    q2 --> q2: Y → Y, L
    q2 --> q0: X → X, R
    q0 --> q_accept: B → B, R
```

### Example 2

$$
L = \{ww^R \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}
$$

(palindromes)

Strategy:

- Compare first and last unmatched symbols
- Mark matched symbols and shrink inward
- Reject on mismatch, accept when all symbols are matched

## 5. Variants of Turing Machines

All variants below are equivalent in language recognition power to the standard single-tape deterministic TM.

### 5.1 Multi-tape TM

- Has $k$ tapes and $k$ heads
- Transition form:
  $$
  \delta(q, a_1, \dots, a_k) = (q', b_1, \dots, b_k, d_1, \dots, d_k)
  $$
- Can be simulated by a single-tape TM (polynomial overhead)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph MTM ["Multi-tape TM"]
        direction TB
        C[Finite Control]
        T1[Tape 1] --- H1[Head 1]
        T2[Tape 2] --- H2[Head 2]
        C --- H1
        C --- H2
    end
```

### 5.2 Non-deterministic TM (NDTM)

Transition relation:

$$
\delta: Q \times \Gamma \to \mathcal{P}(Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\})
$$

A deterministic TM can simulate an NDTM (possibly with exponential slowdown), so NDTM does not increase computability power.

### 5.3 Other Equivalent Variants

- Multi-head TM
- 2D tape TM
- Off-line TM (read-only input tape + work tape)

All can be encoded by the standard model.

## 6. Church-Turing Thesis

> **Church-Turing Thesis:** Every effectively computable function is computable by a Turing Machine.

This is a thesis, not a theorem, because it connects a formal model to the informal notion of algorithm.

Why it is accepted:

- Multiple independent models (lambda calculus, recursive functions, register machines) have the same power as TMs.
- No physically realizable general model has been shown to exceed TM-computability for algorithmic tasks.

Implication:

If a problem is algorithmically solvable, then some TM solves it.

## Summary Table

| Variant | Description | Equivalent to single-tape DTM? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single-tape DTM | Standard model | Yes |
| Multi-tape DTM | Several tapes | Yes |
| Non-deterministic TM | Multiple choices per move | Yes |
| Multi-head TM | Multiple heads on one tape | Yes |
| 2D tape TM | Grid-style tape | Yes |
| Off-line TM | Separate read-only input tape | Yes |

**Key takeaway:** Turing Machines provide a robust and stable definition of computation. Equivalent TM variants reinforce the Church-Turing thesis and help classify computable vs non-computable problems.

## Mermaid: Simulating Multi-tape with Single Tape

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Multi-tape TM] -->|Encode tracks with separators| B[Single tape with delimiter #]
    B -->|Mark virtual head positions| C[Simulate one transition step]
    C --> D[Repeat until halt]
```

A single tape can store all tape tracks with separators and markers, proving equivalence in computational power.
